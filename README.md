# FastAPI

This FastAPI controller module facilitates user authentication via facial recognition. It consists of multiple endpoints: GET /application/: Renders the login page with embedded facial recognition. POST /application/: Validates the user's facial embeddings upon login, authenticating them if successful.

It works by identifying and measuring facial features in an image. Facial recognition can identify human faces in images or videos, determine if the face in two images belongs to the same person, or search for a face among a large collection of existing images.
